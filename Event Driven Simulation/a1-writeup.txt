Which method (single queue, multi-queue) appears to be preferable and why? Note specific values in
your results when explaining why

- the single queue simulation appears to be preferable in this simulation.
The average wait time is consistently lower for the single queue implementation.
The averages for "in system" time and the customers turned away also seem to be slightly less with the single queue implementation.
When the simulation is run with 4 tellers in the single Queue implementation the number of customers served is 232 and the standard deviation is
7.44 whereas for 4 teller in the multi queue implementation the number of customers served was 228 and the standard deviation of the wait time
was 11.943.

How many tellers do you think would be optimal for your bank? Note that this could have more than
one answer, and a more informed answer may require more information from your simulation.
However, try to justify your answer as best you can.

-the optimal amount of tellers would be the number of tellers that optimize the number of customers served without having to pay too many tellers.
When running the simulation with the same input values except for the number of tellers the time ave wait decreases and more customers are served and less are turned away.
Having too many tellers however results in mostly no wait time which would be cost inefficient for a bank and having too little would result in very long wait times.
The optimal amount of tellers would be the number of tellers that allows
for an average wait time of around 10-20 minutes. when running the simulation with different amounts of tellers but the same control variables it seems 4 tellers could be
optimal depending on the customer arrival rate and average service time. 4 tellers results in an average wait time of around 10 minutes for both queue types with only around 5% of customers leaving the bank.
